    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a team of five classmates currently in our second semester pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at our university. In this semester, we have delved into additional subjects such as Git & GitOps and Engineering Toolkit.</p>
    
    <h2>Git & GitOps</h2>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development to track changes in source code during software development. GitOps is a methodology that leverages Git pull requests to manage infrastructure and deployments.</p>
    
    <h2>Engineering Toolkit (ETK)</h2>
    <p>In Engineering Toolkit, we learned tools such as Visual Studio Code for software development and API testing tools for ensuring the functionality and reliability of our applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Below are some projects related to Git & GitOps and Engineering Toolkit that we have completed:</p>
    
    <h3>Git & GitOps Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Project 1: Continuous Integration Pipeline using GitLab CI</a> - This project involved setting up a continuous integration pipeline using GitLab CI to automate the testing and deployment process of a web application.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Project 2: Kubernetes Deployment with GitOps Workflow</a> - We implemented a Kubernetes deployment using GitOps principles, allowing us to manage infrastructure as code and achieve continuous delivery.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Engineering Toolkit Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Project 1: Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express</a> - We developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express framework, and tested its endpoints using API testing tools to ensure functionality and performance.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Project 2: Visual Studio Code Extension for Code Refactoring</a> - We created a Visual Studio Code extension to automate code refactoring tasks, enhancing code quality and maintainability.</li>
    </ul>
